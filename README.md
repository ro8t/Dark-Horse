# Codename: Dark-Horse

### UCB Data Analytics Project One

In this project, we analyze 4 major global metro Systems:
1. London's Tube
2. New York City's Subway
3. São Paulo's Metro
4. San Francisco's BART

Our goal was to analyze the four systems through various data streams and for a conclusion. 
The presentation can be found within the *Project Files* folder.
Unforutnately, we did gather enough data to present any statistically significant conclusions.


Each city has their own data file/folder, labeled accordingly:
- London: tube-data
- New York City: NYC-metro-data
- São Paulo: sao-paulo-metro-data
- San Francisco: BART Data Sources

The program has been written in python with the use of the following libraries:
- Pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

The file name is *bart_project.ipynb*
